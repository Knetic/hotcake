	This example shows how to use Hotcake's "include" parameter to hotload scripts that weren't part of the initial pageload.
	<br>In this case, we use that parameter to load a "version 2" of this page's script file. 
	<br><br>Just pretend that this "version 2" is the same file as before, except it was changed on the server, and we're now hotloading the new version.
	<br>Further examples will use this same pattern, but remember that it's just for the sake of example. In real life, you ought to edit scripts in-place on your server, then hotload them.
