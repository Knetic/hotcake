	You may have noticed a glaring flaw with Hotcake - no model adjustment logic!
	<br>If you make changes to the way you represent your data model between versions, your clients will be stuck using the
	<br>old data model, while your newly hotswapped code will be using logic which depends on the new data model - that's bad.
	<br><br>Hotcke doesn't offer an explicit solution to this, because it's more of a pattern problem than a Hotcake problem.
	<br>However, one easy solution is to have a separate script file, that is not included in the HEAD of your document,
	<br>which handles upgrades between versions of your code and models. In this example, it's named "upgrade.js", and it's
	<br>included in every hotswap, as the very last script evaluated.
	<br><br>Here, we go from a very simple model ("Apple") which contains an integer number of seeds;
	<br>to a model where each seed is described as its own object as part of an array.
